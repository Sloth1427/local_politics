It's common that British MPs represent constituencies away from their birth place. I was interested in how this varied by party. Here are the results.

1. Use script to streamline manually retrieving MP birth places.
2. Use google maps API to retrieve MP birth place lon and lat.
3. Use theyworkforyou.com API to retrieve constituency centroid lon and lat.
4. Calculate distance from birth place to constituency, and plot by party.
5. Plot MP birth places on map using ggplot
